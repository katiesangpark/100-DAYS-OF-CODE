**Thoughts:** A flying spaceship with thurst flames when pressing the keybard 'up', turning the spaceship clockwise or counterclockwise when pressing the keyboard 'right' or 'left', randomly moving rocks on the random position, computing to shoot missiles from the tip of the spaceship...Hard work for me, but had fun, too!
